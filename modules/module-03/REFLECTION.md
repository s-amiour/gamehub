Answer the three questions below. There are no right or wrong answers — we are looking for your reasoning, not a textbook definition. A few honest sentences are worth more than a long generic paragraph.

## 1. The "why"

All client requests now go through the gateway. No client ever calls a service directly.

**Why does that single entry point exist? What would the client's life look like without it?**

Think about what the client would need to know and manage if it talked to each service on its own port.

## 2. Your choice

The activity-service makes two outbound calls: one to validate the user (with retry logic), one to fetch game data (with a null fallback if it fails).

**Why are these two calls treated differently? Why does one retry and the other just give up gracefully?**

What is the consequence for the user in each case if the downstream service is unavailable?

> *Your answer:*

## 3. The tradeoff

Every time a client creates an activity, three services are involved synchronously. They all have to be running, healthy, and fast.

**What is the systemic risk of chaining synchronous calls like this?**

What happens to the user experience if the slowest service in the chain takes 3 seconds to respond?
